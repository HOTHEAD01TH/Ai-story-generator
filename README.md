# Ai-story-generator

This application is designed to generate stories using artificial intelligence.

## Overview

Ai-story-generator leverages the power of AI to create unique and engaging stories based on user-provided prompts or themes. Whether you're looking for a fantastical adventure, a thrilling mystery, or a heartwarming tale, this app can help bring your ideas to life.

## Features

* Generates stories based on user input.
* Allows users to specify genres, characters, and settings (if implemented).
* Provides options for story length and style (if implemented).
* Add any other relevant features

## Technologies Used

* **Backend:**
    * Node.js
    * Express.js: For building the web server and handling API requests.
    * Axios: For making HTTP requests to external AI services.
    * CORS: For enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
    * Dotenv: For managing environment variables.
    * Nodemon: For automatically restarting the server during development.
* **Frontend:** If you have a frontend, list its technologies here. If not, you can omit this or mention it's a backend-only application for now.
    * e.g., React, Vue.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **AI Model/Service:** Mention the AI model or service you are using to generate stories, if applicable
    * e.g., OpenAI API, Google Cloud AI Platform, a locally hosted model
* **Database:** If you are using a database, mention it here
    * e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite

## Installation

### Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    * Copy the `.env.example` file (if you have one) or create a new file named `.env` in the backend directory.
    * Add your environment variables, such as API keys for the AI service:
        ```
        # Example .env file
        AI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
        PORT=3001 # Or your desired port
        # Add other environment variables as needed
        ```
4.  **Run the backend server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev # Or npm start, depending on your scripts in package.json
    ```
    This command typically uses `nodemon` to start the server and watch for changes.

### Frontend Setup If applicable

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Create environment variables:**
    * Similar to the backend, create a `.env` file in the frontend directory if needed, configuring API endpoints or other settings.
4.  **Run the frontend application:**
    ```bash
    npm start # Or yarn start, depending on your frontend framework
    ```
    This will usually start the frontend development server.

## Usage

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to the frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
2.  You will see a text input field where you can enter a prompt or a theme for your story.
3.  Click the "Generate Story" button.
4.  The AI will process your input and generate a unique story, which will be displayed on the screen.
5.  Add instructions for any other features or functionalities

## API Endpoints If applicable

* `POST /api/generate`: Accepts a JSON payload with a `prompt` field and returns a JSON response containing the generated `story`.
    ```json
    {
      "prompt": "A brave knight encounters a mysterious dragon in a dark forest."
    }
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {
      "story": "In the heart of a shadowy forest..."
    }
    ```
* `GET /api/genres`: Returns a list of available story genres.
